# 🌅 Project Genesis: The Dawn of Autonomous Code Evolution

## 📜 Overview
Project Genesis is an open-source initiative designed to automate the software development process by embedding best coding practices such as SRP, testing, and DI. It leverages intelligent agents to interface with various IDEs, enhancing developers' productivity. 

## Disclaimer: This project is opinionated by Manu's perspective on decades of experience in coding.

## 🏛️ Core Principles
- 🧼 **Clean Code**: Ensuring code clarity and maintainability.
- ✅ **Testing**: Prioritizing automated testing for reliable software.
- 🧩 **Modularity**: Adhering to SRP for a structured and scalable codebase.
- 🔧 **Maintainability**: Incorporating DI for flexible and manageable systems.

## 🏗️ Architecture
Project Genesis utilizes a multi-agent system to cover different aspects of both project management and coding:

### Project Management Agents
- 💼 **Monetization Agent**: Analyzes and implements strategies for project monetization in an open-source context.
- 📊 **HR Agent**: Manages project contributors, fostering a skilled and innovative team.
- 🎨 **Branding Agent**: Cultivates the project's public image and outreach strategies.

### Coding Agents
- 🔄 Coordinator Agent: Coordinates all other agents and oversees the entire automated workflow.
- 🏛️ Architecture Agent: Guides the structural design and architectural patterns of the codebase.
- ✂️ Mitosis Agent: Ensures the codebase adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle by refactoring when necessary.
- 🤖 Parser Agent: Analyzes the codebase for SRP compliance and suggests improvements.
- 🔗 Integration Agent: Manages dependencies and respects DI principles for module integration.
- 🧪 Testing Agent: Generates and runs tests to maintain high code quality and functionality.
- 🚀 Deployment Agent: Automates and manages the deployment process through CI/CD pipelines.
- 📝 Documentation Agent: Automatically generates and updates documentation based on the codebase and changes made.
- 📚 Versioning Agent: Handles commits, merges, and other version control operations, maintaining a history of changes and facilitating rollbacks if needed.
- 🖥️ Interface Agent: Integrates the automation toolchain with various IDEs, ensuring a seamless developer experience.
- 🧠 Brain Agent: Interfaces with local or remote LLMs like langchain for enhanced code intelligence.
- 💻 Coding Agent: Generates code based on user input.

## 🔄 Operating Logic and Feedback Loops
Each agent incorporates a feedback mechanism to learn from its operations and outcomes, constantly improving its processes and interactions with other agents.
